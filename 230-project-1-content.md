Welcome to The Zoo! As a lost kid on a field trip to the zoo, the player must avoid strangers by keeping away from them or crying loudly as they 
make their way back to their chaperone. It's Frogger but with more story!

=============

### High Concept

Welcome to a different sight of Frogger, where instead of a frog trying to cross a road/river/
populated area, the player is a small child around elementary age trying to navigate the different areas of a zoo in order to find their teacher.
If the child becomes completely scared (last life/attempt to cross to teacher), they gain the ability to scream and cry, detering strangers for
a short period of time.
The Zoo is a casual puzzle arcade-type game.

### Platform

Universal, but controls would have to be converted to either tracking gesture strokes or overlayed controls in the form of arrow keys

### Story

There isn't a full storyline to follow, due to the nature of the game, but the premise is that you as the player are a child on a field trip to the local zoo to
study animals, when you get separated from the rest of your class. The Player Motivation is to make it safely back without running into any strangers, otherwise you
lose a life, or the character "gets more frustrated and scared", would be the take on it
(or possibly animals)
It's a casual game, so the mood is more that of just "Don't hit anything" with a hint of urgency (maybe emphasized by a timer or many obstacles)

### Aesthetics

Graphics would be cartoonish + pixel art, not too brightly colored but not a dull landscape

Sound - 8-bit music, soft in background, with 8-bit sound effects taking up much more of the audio as the player moves/dies/succeeds.
It wouldn't be based on scoring as the player gets points as they move forwards

Different level types would have different music playing in the background, as well as potentially varying ambient noise to immerse the player

### Gameplay

#### Mechanics

* Endless Game, no determined end in site, just get to the goal as many times as you can without dying or time running out and rack up points

* Possibly Envy if high score chart is added, beat your friends' high scores!

* Hopefully Fun Once, Fun Always, due to the simpleness of the game and the instead added interest in playing

* Urgent Optimism, you either get to the "end" of that single round and win or you lose a life

* Timer so that player doesn't/can't linger in a single round for very long

#### Control

* Arrow Keys on keyboard to move on browser version,
* Touch/gesture on mobile version

* When Ability is activated (must only have a single life left), Left Shift on keyboards to scream, a special new button on mobile overlay

#### Teaching The Game

There will be a tutorial stating the different aspects, including controls, the ability and how to unlock, the concept of the timer, and the premise of the situation (Not in that order)

#### Learning the Methods

The Player needs to learn how to move using given controls, how to best utilize the "last-resort" ability, and locations of "completion", similar to Frogger's select end locations
